## The plan for this project
### Conversational Data Analyst & Visualization Agent
#### Showcases Core AI Developer Skills:
LLM Orchestration: Using frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex to manage complex interactions.

Tool Use/Function Calling: Teaching the agent to "use" data science libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) as tools.

Code Generation & Execution: The agent generates Python code for analysis/visualization, then executes it and interprets results.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Interpreting user questions about data.

Data Handling: Working with various data formats (CSV, Excel).

User Interface (Optional but recommended): A simple web UI for interaction makes it highly demonstrable.

Error Handling/Robustness: Making the agent resilient to unexpected inputs or code errors.

### Project Concept:
Develop an AI agent that allows users to upload a dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel) and then interact with it using natural language. The agent should be able to:

Understand Data: Automatically infer schema, data types, and provide a basic summary.

Answer Questions: Respond to questions about the data (e.g., "What's the average sales?", "Show me the distribution of customer ages.").

Generate Visualizations: Create plots (bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots) based on user requests (e.g., "Plot sales over time," "Show correlation between feature A and feature B.").

Perform Basic Analysis: Conduct simple aggregations, filtering, and potentially statistical tests.

Explain Insights: Provide explanations for the generated results and visualizations.

Handle Ambiguity: Ask clarifying questions if the request is unclear.
